# Kiel Air Quality Analysis

A multitude of factors influences the traffic dependent air quality in Kiel.
We want to find, analyze and make legible different component influences.
For this we need to
- find appropriate data sources for both traffic, air quality and external factors
- create a predictive model trained on this data
- do a factor-of-influence analysis on the different components by measuring model uncertainty
- create a model which is able to predict the future (with some level of quality)
- create a website with an interactive visualization: sliders for the inputs, prediction of the next timesteps

The model/website should be able to answer the following questions:
- does fuel price influence air quality in kiel
- how does weather influence the measurements
